# AudioClassification

Based on the excellent tutorial by Sean Tracey  at https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/Audio-Classification-w.-Convolutional-Neural-Networks.

Added a few elements:

•	Plotting the dataset: showing sample images, which shows how ambitious the task is!
•	Plotting the model’s architecture
•	Tweaking the loss function (binary crossentropy is really fitting better in this case)
•	Implementing early stopping in the training process (and a few epochs)
•	Displaying clear accuracy metrics after training (I was really missing this)
•	Plotting the loss and accuracy during epochs. This shows how epochs play a role and why use early stopping (answer to: how long should the model train?)
•	Cross checking the final results are really that good (they are really amazing =)
